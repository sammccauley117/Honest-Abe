# honest-abe-bot 
@HonestAbe is a Twitter based automated robot that reads U.S. politician's tweets using Python and Tweepy. Honest Abe cross-references a database of
political donations as well as uses sentiment analysis tools to gauge whether a politician's tweet may be biased by their donorâ€™s interests.
Abe replies to a politician and calls them out on their potential bias if their tweet is deemed a conflict of interest. 
Honest Abe is not currently running because approximately 25% of the tweets it sent out were not accurate, and that is unacceptable--improvements need
to be made.
